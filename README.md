# Alicia's Class Project Website

This is a class project website created for a master's class at UCLA.

## Description

This website serves as a showcase of my skills in web development and machine learning. It includes various components and features that demonstrate my ability to integrate different technologies and create an interactive user experience.

## Features
- **Embeded Interactive Map**: An interactive map shows all the countries I've visited.
- **Embeded Playlist**: Showcasing a Spotify playlist of my favorite music.
- **Teachable Machine**: Allow webcam on! The bottom features a Teachable Machine project, where I demonstrates machine learning concepts by using a webcam to predict and display whether or not you're wearing sunglasses in real-time.
